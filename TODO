Resources:
    [ ] For every endpoint that supports query params, we should return a builder type for easily providing those
    [ ] Create methods in order to get PagedResponse back
    [ ] PagedResponse should provide an iteration mechanism over the rest of the pages
    [ ] Create a nice builder structure in order to create the URIs. That way we can only unit test this and be safe and sure

General:
    [ ] Provide a simpler, blocking version of this library
